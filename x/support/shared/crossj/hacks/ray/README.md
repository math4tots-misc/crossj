Just some code working through the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge" by Jamis Buck

sticks with the Phong model and doesn't really do a globally illuminated model
(i.e. "real" ray tracing).

From merging ray3:

Instead of following the books/articles,
for this one, I'm treating those references more like guidelines.
