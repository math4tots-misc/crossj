At some point, I might want to turn this directory into 'crossj-core',
make a parent pom, and have the libraries for crossj in a separate
directory with its own pom.
Ideally, I'd like to just have everything live in one big root, but
I'm starting to notice my IDE's quality starting to degrade a bit
